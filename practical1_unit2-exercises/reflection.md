# Reflection on Practical1_Unit2Exercises
This document contains my reflections on the topics covered in the **Practical1_Unit2-exercises** folder.
For each section, I have described what I learned, the challenges I faced, and the ways I overcame them. I was not able to include screenshots this time, but I will make sure to add them in future reflections.

---

### 1. Basics
### What I Learned
Gained an understanding of core concepts like numbers, strings, booleans, and type conversions.

Practiced simple Python programs that involved taking input from the user and displaying results.

### Challenges Faced

Remembering the correct syntax for type conversions (int(), str(), float()) was tricky at first.

I often mixed up when to use single quotes versus double quotes in strings.

### How I Overcame Them

I created small practice programs to reinforce the correct syntax.

With consistent practice, I became more confident in converting types and handling strings.

### 2. Data Structures
### What I Learned

Explored the use of lists, dictionaries, and sets.

Practiced adding, updating, and retrieving values.

### Challenges Faced

I initially found it confusing to distinguish between lists and dictionaries.

I sometimes forgot that lists are ordered, while sets are not.

I often used the wrong kind of brackets.

### How I Overcame Them

I worked on exercises like adding items to lists, updating dictionaries, and checking set membership.

Using real-world examples (e.g., “shopping list” for lists, “student information” for dictionaries) made the differences clearer.

Frequent use helped me get used to the correct brackets.

### 3. Control Structures
### What I Learned

Practiced using if/else conditions, for loops, and while loops.

Learned how break and continue affect loop execution.

### Challenges Faced

I sometimes created infinite loops by forgetting to update variables.

I was unsure when to use for versus while.

### How I Overcame Them

I added print statements to monitor what was happening inside loops.

Over time, I understood that for is better when the number of repetitions is known, while while works well for condition-based loops.

### 4. Flowcharts and Pseudocode
### What I Learned

Learned to write pseudocode and represent algorithms through flowcharts.

Understood how to structure problems step by step before coding.

Practiced drawing flowcharts by hand and inserting them into VS Code.

### Challenges Faced

At first, I wrote pseudocode too much like Python code instead of keeping it simple.

I also struggled with properly connecting flowchart shapes.

### How I Overcame Them

I reviewed class examples and followed a consistent Input → Process → Output structure.

Practicing with simple tasks, such as calculating the area of a rectangle, made it easier.

### 5. Functions
What I Learned

Learned how to define functions with parameters and return values.

Understood the importance of scope, including local and global variables.

### Challenges Faced

Sometimes I forgot to include return when I needed to pass back a result.

I was confused when variables with the same name existed both inside and outside a function.

### How I Overcame Them

I tested functions by printing outputs to see the results.

I used descriptive variable names and practiced writing functions for small problems to avoid confusion.

### 6. Arithmetic and Comparisons
What I Learned

Practiced using arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %) and comparison operators (<, >, ==, !=).

Applied these operators in conditions and loops.

### Challenges Faced

I often confused = (assignment) with == (comparison).

I was sometimes surprised when division returned a float instead of an integer.

### How I Overcame Them

By practicing examples, I became more comfortable with the difference between assignment and comparison.

I also learned to use // whenever integer division was required.

### Overall Reflection

This unit has given me a strong foundation in Python. Each topic built on the last, which made learning easier and more connected. While I initially struggled with loops and functions, regular practice helped me improve both my problem-solving and programming skills.

### Future Improvements

I want to write more programs that combine different concepts from this unit.

I plan to use pseudocode and flowcharts more regularly to reduce errors before coding.

I will continue practicing small exercises until I feel fully confident.

My goal is to strengthen my understanding and eventually master all of these topics.
