# Practical Report 1 – CSF101

## Purpose of the Practical

1. These exercises are designed to help us practise essential Python basics, including data types, control structures, file handling, data structures, and arithmetic operations.
2. The tasks also reinforce writing algorithms, pseudocode, and flowcharts to solve different programming problems.

## Instructions and Solutions

### 1. Basics

#### 1.1 Boolean

* **Task 1:** Create two boolean variables, `is_student` and `is_employed`, and assign them either `True` or `False`.
* **Task 2:** Use the `and` operator to check if you are both a student and employed.
* **Task 3:** Use the `or` operator to check if you are either a student or employed.

**Solution:**

#### 1.2 Numbers

* **Task 1:** Create variables `age` and `height` and store your age and height.
* **Task 2:** Calculate your age in days and store it in `age_in_days`.
* **Task 3:** Divide your age by 7 and print the output.

## 2. Control Structures

### 2.1 Loops

Use both **for** and **while** loops to complete the following:

* (a) Print whole numbers from 1 to 5.
* (b) Use a while loop to print numbers from 5 down to 1.
* (c) Generate a multiplication table using nested loops.
* (d) Calculate the sum of values from 1 to 11 using a for loop.
* (e) Loop through a list of fruits and print each item.

### 2.2 Conditionals

Use `if` and `else` statements to achieve the following:

* (a) Check if a number is positive.
* (b) Create a simple grading system.
* (c) Use a ternary operator to determine if a number is even or odd.
* (d) Build a basic calculator.
