# Reflection on Practical 2

This file contains my reflections on the topics covered in the Practical 2 folder. For each topic, I wrote what I learned, the challenges I faced, and how I overcame them.

## 1. Fibonacci
### 1.1 Iterative Approach
#### What I Learned
- Learned how to generate the Fibonacci sequence using loops.
#### Challenges Faced
- I sometimes misplaced the update order of variables, which caused wrong outputs.
#### How I Overcame Them
- I carefully rewrote the logic step by step and tested with small examples until it worked correctly.

### 1.2 Recursive Approach
#### What I Learned
- Understood how recursion can solve Fibonacci by breaking it into smaller subproblems.
- Learned why base cases are necessary to stop infinite calls.
#### Challenges Faced
- I found it confusing when the recursive calls kept repeating and was unsure how the results were combined.
#### How I Overcame Them
- I traced the recursion on paper and added print statements to see the order of execution clearly.

##  Overall Reflection
Practical 2 helped me understand both iterative and recursive approaches to solving problems. By practicing both methods, I improved my logical thinking and coding skills.

### Future Improvements
-I want to try solving other problems like Fibonacci or GCD using both methods.
-I plan to focus on analyzing which approach is more efficient for different tasks.
