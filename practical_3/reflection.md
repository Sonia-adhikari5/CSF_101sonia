# Reflection on Practical 3

This file contains my reflections on the topics covered in the Practical 3 folder. For each topic, I wrote what I learned, the challenges I faced, and how I overcame them. 

---

## 1. Queue
### 1.1 Queue Implementation
#### What I Learned
- Learned how to search for an element in a list by checking one item at a time.
#### Challenges Faced
- Sometimes my loop skipped elements when I placed the return statement incorrectly.
#### How I Overcame Them
- Reviewed the loop carefully and tested with multiple inputs until I got consistent results.

## 2. Stack
### 2.1 Stack Implementation
#### What I Learned
- Learned how to implement a stack using Python classes with push, pop, and peek methods.
#### Challenges Faced
- I sometimes popped from an empty stack without error handling, which caused crashes.
#### How I Overcame Them
- Added conditions to handle empty stacks and wrote multiple test cases to validate stack operations.
- Practiced visualizing the stack as a real pile of items to understand push and pop behavior.

##  Overall Reflection
Practical 3 helped me understand essential data structures like stacks and queues. Implementing them in Python improved my coding skills, logical thinking, and ability to handle edge cases.

### Future Improvements
-I want to explore advanced data structures like dequeues and priority queues.
-I plan to practice solving problems using stacks and queues, such as expression evaluation or task scheduling.
