# Reflection on Practical 4

This file contains my reflections on the topics covered in the Practical 4 folder. For each topic, I wrote what I learned, the challenges I faced, and how I overcame them.

## 1. Linked Lists
### 1.1 Singly Linked List
#### What I Learned
- Learned how to implement a singly linked list in Python using classes.
#### Challenges Faced
- Made mistakes in updating next pointers, which led to broken lists.
#### How I Overcame Them
- Wrote helper functions to print the list and check its structure.

### 1.2 Reverse Linked List
#### What I Learned
- Learned how to reverse a singly linked list by updating pointers.
#### Challenges Faced
- Found it confusing to update pointers correctly without losing nodes.
#### How I Overcame Them
- Drew diagrams to help understand the reversal process and practiced with helper functions.

##  Overall Reflection
Practical 4 helped me understand linked lists and how to manipulate them. By implementing and reversing lists, I improved my understanding of pointers and data structures.

### Future Improvements
- I want to practice more problems involving linked lists and their variations.
- I plan to explore more complex operations on linked lists in future exercises.
